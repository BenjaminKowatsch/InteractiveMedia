# Web Performance Optimization for Continuous Deployment 
The performance of websites today is a decisive factor in how many users visit them and thus how much money can be earned from them. The impact of this fact is further enhanced by the widespread use of mobile devices and the speed of the mobile Internet.  
To counteract the development of heavyweight websites, web performance optimizations should be integrated into the development process as early as possible.  
As part of this blog post I want to address this topic in the context of Continous Deployment using the following sections.
